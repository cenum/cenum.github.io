The **Central European Network of Urban Morphology** (CENUM) is a regional network of the International Seminar on Urban Form (ISUF) dedicated to the study of urban form within the diverse cultural and historical contexts of Central Europe. Its primary objectives are to encourage collaboration and dialogue across national and disciplinary boundaries, to provide a structured platform for the exchange of methodologies, findings, and theoretical perspectives, and to enhance the visibility of research in the field. By foregrounding the shared, yet varied, traditions of Central European urbanism, the network seeks to define and consolidate the notion of Central European urban morphology as a recognised domain of scholarly inquiry, while situating it within the wider international community of urban studies.
